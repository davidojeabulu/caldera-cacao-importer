This folder contains test playbooks to test the functionality of the plugin.

Note that they only contain the necessary fields to construct a profile within Caldera (the extra fields are omitted).

These profiles represent the respective profiles within Caldera
(e.g. the Super Spy playbook was constructed based on the Super Spy profile within Caldera).

Note that the SuperSpyCaldera.json playbook uses exclusively the ability ids within Caldera to generate the Caldera profile.
This feature is supported by the plugin.
